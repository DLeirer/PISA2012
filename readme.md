# Analysis of Gender Differences in PISA 2012 data
## by Daniel Leirer


## Dataset

The dataset used is the PISA 2012 data. It was downloaded from the udacity server. 
The dataset contains data on 485,490 students belonging to 66 countries. The dataset includes demographic information, test scores, and questionairs relating to wealth, wellbeing, and school performance. In total it contains 635 variables. 

## Summary of Findings

In my exploration I focused on Gender differences and academic achievement in the form of the PV5 Maths, Reading and Science scores. 
There was nothing paticularliy noteworthy about these core variables across the entire dataset. 

I then created dummy variables for Gender and created a correlation matrix to find variables that are highly associated with gender. 
The strongest relationship was with reading score (-0.17). 

I decided to do subset analysis on specific countries. To do this I wanted to know which countries had the biggest internal difference in male and female performance. I calculated the mean difference for each country by subtracting the mean female score from the mean male score. 

The plot showed that in Jordan females outperformed males in all three subjects. This was really surprising and I decided to select 5 other countries to compare Jordan with. 

I looked at math anxiety and wealth in some core countries and found some slight associations. 

I found that jordanian boys are much more liekly to "feel like an outsider" and "to feel that school is a waste of time" than jordanian girls or students from other countries. While this did not fully explain the gender gap in jordan it gave some insight into the structural problem present there. 

I also looked at the relationship between number of books at home and reading score and found a positive relationship. 


## Key Insights for Presentation

I decided to present the jordanian data in the presentation.
